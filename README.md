## Description of this project
This project is a todo-list made with **React**.

There are hooks as "useState" or "UseEffect".

As soon as you run your project, you can start to create todos.

*(Don't forget to run the [todo-server](https://github.com/MoniSwon/todo-server) by the way)*

If you want to edit a todo, you will have an "Edit" button that will show you a Modal with all the fields you want to edit. *This one was kinda tough for me, but I made it üòÅ, it's my first Modal ! And it's a React Modal !*

You can also remove a todo with the button "Remove".

* There is 1 non-functional thing in my project.

It's the Sort selection.

Why is it non-functionnal ? Because I'm a bad student making her homework the last day.
